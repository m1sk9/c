### Force push

Forces a push to a remote repository.

In combination with the rebase function, for example, it allows you to delete or modify a specific history, but at the cost of destroying the commit history for that branch.

```sh
git push -f
```

  If you are not familiar with the Git spec, you should not use force-push.
